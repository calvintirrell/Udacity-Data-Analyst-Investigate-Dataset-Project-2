# Udacity Data Analyst Investigate Dataset Project 2
This is my repository for the project and files for the second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

# Description
The goal of this project is to choose a dataset from the available choices and then go through the data analysis process.
This project utilized the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Finally, everything came together for conclusions.
The specific dataset I use in this project is "No-show appointments". I analyze the data to see if any trends or correlations exist for why people in this missed (or didn't) their appointments.
